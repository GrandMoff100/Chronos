A timeless debugger in python. Meaning you can step forward AND backward through your code

Work in progress. Need to do some redesigning to make backwards steps work. stepping over and into works, but isn't robust yet. you could break it very easily by trying to step into a non function and probably a bunch of other ways too.

Also don't really know what im doing with toml yet but i have it there because i plan on using it
